## Introduction

This guide will cover how to use Uniswap's smart order router to compute optimal routes and execute swaps. Rather than trading between a single pool, smart routing may use multiple hops (as many as needed) to ensure that the end result of the swap is the optimal price. It is based on the [routing code example](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/tree/main/v3-sdk/routing), found in the Uniswap code examples [repository](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples). To run this example, check out the guide's [README](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/v3-sdk/routing/README.md) and follow the setup instructions.

In this example we will trade between **WETH and USDC**, but you can configure your example to us any two currencies and amount of input currency.

The guide will **cover**:

1. Creating a router instance
2. Creating a route
3. Swapping using a route

At the end of the guide, we should be able to create a route and and execute a swap between any two currencies tokens using the example's included UI.

For this guide, the following Uniswap packages are used:

- [`@uniswap/v3-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/v3-sdk)
- [`@uniswap/sdk-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/sdk-core)
- [`@uniswap/smart-order-router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/smart-order-router)

The core code of this guide can be found in [`routing.ts`](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/v3-sdk/routing/src/libs/routing.ts)

## Creating a router instance

To compute our route, we will use the `@uniswap/smart-order-router` package, specifically the `AlphaRouter` class which requires a `chainId` and a `provider`. Note that routing is not supported for local forks, so we will use a mainnet provider even when swapping on a local fork:

```js copy
  const router = new AlphaRouter({
    chainId: ChainId.MAINNET,
    provider: getMainnetProvider(),
  })
```

## Creating a route

Next, we will create our options conforming to the `SwapOptionsSwapRouter02` interface, defining the wallet to use, slippage tolerance, and deadline for the transaction:

```js copy
  const options: SwapOptionsSwapRouter02 = {
    recipient: CurrentConfig.wallet.address,
    slippageTolerance: new Percent(50, 10_000),
    deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000 + 1800),
    type: SwapType.SWAP_ROUTER_02,
  }
```

Using these options, we can now create a trade (`TradeType.EXACT_INPUT` or `TradeType.EXACT_OUTPUT`) with the currency and the input amount to use to get a quote. For this example, we'll use an `EXACT_INPUT` trade to get a quote outputted in the quote currency.

```js copy
  const route = await router.route(
    CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(
      CurrentConfig.currencies.in,
      fromReadableAmount(
        CurrentConfig.currencies.amountIn,
        CurrentConfig.currencies.in.decimals
      ).toString()
    ),
    CurrentConfig.currencies.out,
    TradeType.EXACT_INPUT,
    options
  )
```

## Swapping using a route


First, we need to give approval to the `SwapRouter` smart contract to spend our tokens for us:

```js copy
  const tokenApproval = await getTokenTransferApproval(CurrentConfig.tokens.in)
```

Once the approval has been granted and using the route, we can now execute the trade using the route's computed calldata, values, and gas values:


```js copy
  const res = await sendTransaction({
    data: route.methodParameters?.calldata,
    to: V3_SWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS,
    value: route?.methodParameters?.value,
    from: address,
    maxFeePerGas: MAX_FEE_PER_GAS,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: MAX_PRIORITY_FEE_PER_GAS,
  })
```

After swapping, you should see the currency balances update in the UI shortly after the block is confirmed.
