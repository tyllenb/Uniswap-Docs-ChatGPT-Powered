## Introduction

This guide will cover how to create (or mint) a liquidity position on the Uniswap V3 protocol.
It is based on the [minting a position code example](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/tree/main/v3-sdk/minting-position), found in the Uniswap code examples [repository](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples).
To run this example, check out the examples's [README](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/v3-sdk/minting-posotion/README.md) and follow the setup instructions.

In the Uniswap V3 protocol, liquidity positions are represented using non-fungible tokens. In this guide we will use the `NonfungiblePositionManager` class to help us mint a liquidity position for the  **USDC - DAI** pair. The inputs to our guide are the **two tokens** that we are pooling for, the **amount** of each token we are pooling for and the Pool **fee**.

The guide will **cover**:

1. Giving approval to transfer our tokens
2. Creating an instance of a `Pool`
3. Calculating our `Position` from our input tokens
4. Configuring and executing our minting transaction

At the end of the guide, given the inputs above, we should be able to mint a liquidity position with the press of a button and view the position on the UI of the web application.

For this guide, the following Uniswap packages are used:

- [`@uniswap/v3-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/v3-sdk)
- [`@uniswap/sdk-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/sdk-core)
- [`@uniswap/smart-order-router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/smart-order-router)

The core code of this guide can be found in [`mintPosition()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/v3-sdk/minting-position/src/libs/positions.ts#L37)

## Giving approval to transfer our tokens

The first step is to give approval to the protocol's `NonfungiblePositionManager` to transfer our tokens:

```js copy
  const tokenInApproval = await getTokenTransferApproval(
    CurrentConfig.tokens.token0
  )
  const tokenOutApproval = await getTokenTransferApproval(
    CurrentConfig.tokens.token1
  )
```

The logic to achieve that is wrapped in the `getTokenTransferApprovals` function. In short, since both **USDC** and **DAI** are ERC20 tokens, we setup a reference to their smart contracts and call the `approve` function:

```js copy
    const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(
      token.address,
      ERC20_ABI,
      provider
    )

    const transaction = await tokenContract.populateTransaction.approve(
      NONFUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      TOKEN_AMOUNT_TO_APPROVE_FOR_TRANSFER
    )
```

## Creating an instance of a `Pool`

Having approved the transfer of our tokens, we now need to get data about the pool for which we will provide liquidity, in order to instantiate a Pool class.

To start, we compute our Pool's address by using a helper function and passing in the unique identifiers of a Pool - the **two tokens** and the Pool **fee**. The **fee** input parameter represents the swap fee that is distributed to all in range liquidity at the time of the swap:

```js copy
  const currentPoolAddress = computePoolAddress({
    factoryAddress: POOL_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    tokenA: CurrentConfig.tokens.token0,
    tokenB: CurrentConfig.tokens.token1,
    fee: CurrentConfig.tokens.poolFee,
  })
```

Then, we get the Pool's data by creating a reference to the Pool's smart contract and accessing its methods:

```js copy
  const poolContract = new ethers.Contract(
    currentPoolAddress,
    IUniswapV3PoolABI.abi,
    provider
  )

  const [token0, token1, fee, tickSpacing, liquidity, slot0] =
    await Promise.all([
      poolContract.token0(),
      poolContract.token1(),
      poolContract.fee(),
      poolContract.tickSpacing(),
      poolContract.liquidity(),
      poolContract.slot0(),
    ])
```

Having collected the required data, we can now create an instance of the `Pool` class:

```js copy
  const configuredPool = new Pool(
    token0Amount.currency,
    token1Amount.currency,
    poolInfo.fee,
    poolInfo.sqrtPriceX96.toString(),
    poolInfo.liquidity.toString(),
    poolInfo.tick
  )
```

## Calculating our `Position` from our input tokens

Having created the instance of the `Pool` class, we can now use that to create an instance of a `Position` class, which represents the price range for a specific pool that LPs choose to provide in:

```js copy
  return Position.fromAmounts({
    pool: configuredPool,
    tickLower:
      nearestUsableTick(poolInfo.tick, poolInfo.tickSpacing) -
      poolInfo.tickSpacing * 2,
    tickUpper:
      nearestUsableTick(poolInfo.tick, poolInfo.tickSpacing) +
      poolInfo.tickSpacing * 2,
    amount0: token0Amount.quotient,
    amount1: token1Amount.quotient,
    useFullPrecision: true,
  })
```

We use the `fromAmounts` static function of the `Position` class to create an instance of it, which uses the following parameters:

- The **tickLower** and **tickUpper** parameters specify the price range at which to provide liquidity. This example calls **nearestUsableTick** to get the current useable tick and adjust the lower parameter to be below it by two **tickSpacing** and the upper to be above it by two tickSpacing. This guarantees that the provided liquidity is "in range", meaning it will be earning fees upon minting this position
- **amount0** and **amount1** define the maximum amount of currency the liquidity position can use. In this example, we supply these from our configuration parameters.

Given those parameters, `fromAmounts` will attempt to calculate the maximum amount of liquidity we can supply.

## Configuring and executing our minting transaction

The Position instance is then passed as input to the `NonfungiblePositionManager`'s `addCallParameters` function. The function also requires an [`AddLiquidityOptions`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-sdk/blob/08a7c050cba00377843497030f502c05982b1c43/src/nonfungiblePositionManager.ts#L77) object as its second parameter. This is either of type [`MintOptions`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-sdk/blob/08a7c050cba00377843497030f502c05982b1c43/src/nonfungiblePositionManager.ts#L74) for minting a new position or [`IncreaseOptions`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-sdk/blob/08a7c050cba00377843497030f502c05982b1c43/src/nonfungiblePositionManager.ts#L75) for adding liquidity to an existing position. For this example, we're using a `MintOptions` to create our position.

```js copy
  const mintOptions: MintOptions = {
    recipient: address,
    deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 20,
    slippageTolerance: new Percent(50, 10_000),
  }

  // get calldata for minting a position
  const { calldata, value } = NonfungiblePositionManager.addCallParameters(
    positionToMint,
    mintOptions
  )
```

The function returns the calldata as well as the value required to execute the transaction:

```js copy
  const transaction = {
    data: calldata,
    to: NONFUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    value: value,
    from: address,
    maxFeePerGas: MAX_FEE_PER_GAS,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: MAX_PRIORITY_FEE_PER_GAS,
  }

  return sendTransaction(transaction)
```

The effect of the transaction is to mint a new Position NFT. We should see a new position with liquidity in our list of positions.

## Next Steps

Once you have minted a position, our next guide ([Adding and Removing Liquidity](./adding_and_removing_position)) will demonstrate how you can add and remove liquidity from that minted position!
